# ACore-2025

## Project Overview

This implementation serves as the final project (term assignment) for the CS2952 course. It is a 64-bit operating system developed using the Rust programming language, targeting the RISC-V architecture and designed specifically for single-core processor environments. The system runs within the QEMU emulator, providing a controlled and accessible development environment. This implementation builds upon the educational foundation of rCore, a teaching-oriented operating system developed at Tsinghua University.
